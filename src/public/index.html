<!-- TODO: idk about ngrok. everytime i have to push to gh I have to shut it down. it gives me a different url at start up. You have to pay for a reserved domain.
that's pointless. It's probably only good when you have a satisfactory product to show. I've set up heroku to host, may just go with that to share with Christine.
 next steps: set up something that she can see, also I could use this as a template for the "Bee" project.
